				<h2> One of my favorite quotes </h2>

					<blockquote>
					"One night I dreamed I was running. When I woke up I forgot I had a limp, so I walked totally normal until I remembered, 'oh, yeah, I have a limp'. Then I immediately stumbled. That showed me that if you have control over your mind, you can do anything."<br>
					-Jason Becker
